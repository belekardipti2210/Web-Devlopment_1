This project is my personal portfolio website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It showcases my skills, projects, certifications, and achievements in a clean and responsive design.
The portfolio includes sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, making it easy for visitors to learn about my work and connect with me. 
The main goal of this project is to present my profile in a professional and interactiveÂ way.
